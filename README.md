# Phase_2_Final_Project

## Business Understanding

Do home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes? By what amount?
Stakholders can be considered private homeowners, investors, renovators and real estate agencies and buyers as well. Renovating a house can be considered an interesting alternative when it comes to acquire a property in the real estate market.
It can constitute, among other advantages, a lucrative purchase as, after renovation, the property can be sold at a higher price, with a relative important profitable margin.
Data source is the King County House for Sale.

##Data Undertanding

It consists of a considerably large data set: 21957 entries per 21 columns, before cleaning; 15029 rows per 22 columns, after cleaning.
No information was given about the circumstances and ways the data were harvested.
Features and potential predicors are represented by columns labels that are also accompained by an explanatory document.

## Data Preparation

After detecting missing values, I dealt with them by deletion.
I performed data type conversion as need as well as categorical data, taken as predictor variable, in dummy variables.
I proceeded also with log transformation in order to ensure a normal distribution.
Given the nature of the business problem I have to answer to, I performed a simple linear regression.

## Conclusions
Results and their meaning in the terms proposed by the business problem were interpreted and explained.
